# Bone Marrow Segmentation

Bone Marrow Segmentation (BMS) is the problem domain of automatic segmentation of different tissues in bone-marrow biopsy samples.
The application of BMS is mostly relevant for medical research purposes. In particular, BMS is used for researching the co-relation between the relative volume of fat/bone tissue in the biopsy and diseases.

**Our goal is to automate segmentation of different tissues in a bone-marrow biopsy sample.**
